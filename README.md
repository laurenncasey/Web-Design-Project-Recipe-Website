# 🍽️ Recipe Website — Web Design Project

This project was developed as part of the **Web Design** course at the **University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire**. The assignment involved creating a fully functional website for a hypothetical client. I chose to build a dynamic **Recipe Website** that allows users to browse, search, and view various recipes, while meeting all technical requirements of the course.
