# Web Design Project: Recipe Website
This project was completed as part of the Web Design course at UW-Eau Claire, where the assignment was to create a fully functional website for a hypothetical client. I chose to build a Recipe Website that allows users to browse, search, and view various recipes, while meeting the technical requirements outlined in the project.

Project Requirements & Features:
JavaScript Animation: Implemented dynamic visual effects to enhance the user experience, such as interactive elements and animations on the homepage.
PHP & MySQL Integration: Connected the website to a MySQL database using PHP to store and retrieve recipe data, including ingredients, preparation steps, and user-submitted recipes.
CSS Stylesheets: Used custom CSS styles and Flexbox for a responsive, modern layout that works across desktop and mobile devices.
HTML Structure: The website includes a minimum of 10 pages, providing a rich and diverse user experience, with dedicated sections for recipe categories, individual recipe pages, and user-submitted content.
Form Handling: Integrated a working form where users can submit new recipes. Utilized PHPâ€™s $_POST[] and $_GET[] methods to handle form data submission and retrieval.
