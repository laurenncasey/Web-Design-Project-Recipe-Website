    <p>

            From the moment Alaina could walk, you could catch her in the kitchen, standing on a little step stool, snacking on ingredients that her Dad was prepping for dinner. Only difference is, now she can see over the counter and it is Alaina and her Dad cooking together as a team.
            
            Chef Alaina has had a passion for cooking since she was a little kid. She would find herself in the kitchen in times of stress. She found that her troubles seemed to be figured out by the time she finished baking. 
            </p>
            <p>
            This passion led Chef Alaina to attending Saint Paul College to attain her Associates Degree in Culinary Arts. Culinary school was a blast for her and showed her a how to look at food in a new light, one with honed skills and knowledge that she had otherwise not known. Today, Alaina is working full-time and attending college to complete her Bachelors Degree in Food Science.
