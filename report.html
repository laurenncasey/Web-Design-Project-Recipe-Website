<h1>Client Review</h1>
<p>Loved the color scheme and fonts, felt they represented her warm feelings of cooking. Said she needed some better photos and to use what we have and she will provide better ones for the future. For the published version, get rid of the review forms. (She knows it's a requirement for the project). 
</p>

<h1>Changes Made from In Class</h1>
<p>I have made the recipe layout more of a holy grail layout than a recipe book look like before. I've fixed image sizes upon window size change. And I've added a constant header of images across the top of the main and recipe pages. </p>

    <li>bananabread.php</li>
    <li>chocchipcookie.php</li>
